This python program uses a deep neural network model and two regression techniques (multiple linear and random forest) from the sklearn package and two slowly-evolving factors (Madden-Julian Oscillation, or MJO, and soil moisture) to predict daily maximum surface temperature, minimum surface temperature, and accumulated precipitation from 1980-2019 for one midlatitude and one subtropical surface station in South America. Data are randomly split 70-30 into training and testing datasets. The accuracy of the deep neural network and each regression technique is determined by the root mean squared error (RMSE) for each of the 3 predicted variables.

The precipitation and temperature station data is provided by the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC), with the two selected surface stations being located near Bahia Blanca, Argentina (38.733°S, 62.167°W; GHCND:AR000877500) and Rivera, Uruguay (30.975°S, 55.476°W; GHCND:UYM00086350). The MJO index data (OLR+U850+U200) is provided by the Japan Meteorological Agency (https://ds.data.jma.go.jp/tcc/tcc/products/clisys/mjo/moni_mjo.html), with phase and amplitude used as features for prediction. Daily soil moisture from the first two ground levels (0-7cm and 7-28cm) averaged over a 0.5° x 0.5° box surrounding each station is provided by ERA5 reanalysis and used as features. The MJO and ERA5 data are lagged at 5-day intervals from 5-30 days to test the predictability at a broad range of lead times relevant for the two selected slowly-evolving factors, with this lagged data also used as features.
